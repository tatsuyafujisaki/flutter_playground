# iOS

## What if `pod install` shows the following warning.
```
[!] CocoaPods did not set the base configuration of your project because your project already has a custom config set. In order for CocoaPods integration to work at all, please either set the base configurations of the target `Runner` to `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig` or include the `Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig` in your build configuration (`Flutter/Release.xcconfig`).
```
### Solution
1. Open the workspace.
    ```shell
    ios/Runner.xcworkspace
    ```
2. Select `Runner` in the leftmost column (`Navigators` > `Project`)
3. Select `Runner` in `PROJECT` in the second leftmost column.
3. Select the `Info` tab.
4. Select the following in `Conigurations`.
    - `Debug` > `Runner` > `Pods-Runner.debug`
    - `Release` > `Runner` > `Pods-Runner.release`
    - `Profile` > `Runner` > `Pods-Runner.profile`
    - `Debug`/`Release`/`Profile` > `Runner` > (nested inner) `Runner` > `None`
    - `Debug`/`Release`/`Profile` > `Runner` > `RunnerTests` > `None`
